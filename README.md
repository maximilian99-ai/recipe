# Summary of key features
- Implementing screen navigation with the Stack navigation.

- To move the screen, define a navigation function in the parent component and bind it to the child component as an onPress event handler, and in the child component, bind it by passing it down as a prop received from the parent component.

- In order to apply styles when pressing screen elements such as buttons, style properties are added to the parameters of the screen components, the default styles are placed in an array, and new styles are added as elements to the array and merged together. The added style property parameters can also be used in external components.

- Use the Platform API to set styles by OS.
